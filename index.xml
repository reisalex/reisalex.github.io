      <description>Synthetic biologists, our group included, have been drawn by the power of CRISPR technologies1 to completely revolutionize how we program cell behavior, for example, by designing programmable CRISPR-based genetic circuits. Genetic circuits, like digital ones, take input signals from the surrounding environment (e.g. relevant biologics, chemicals, temperature, UV), and through a series of logic gates, perform computation or “signal processing”, with useful output that can be read out or passed to biological actuators within a programmed cell.</description>

      <description>Over the last few weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, limited availability and throughput of the existing COVID-19 test kit has hindered our ability to monitor the global spread of the causal virus, SARS-CoV-2. As of March 24nd, the CDC reported having only tested 4,651 and 83,391 patients across the U.S. in CDC and public health laboratories, respectively, since January 18th &amp;ndash; with the bulk of those tests done within the past week.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m a hybrid computational-experimental synthetic biology researcher, leveraging biophysical modeling and omics technologies to enable rational engineering of biology. I recently received my PhD under the mentorship of Dr. Howard Salis at Penn State University. My dissertation covered a variety of research topics including biophysical modeling of translation initation rate, nonrepetitive design of DNA, and scaled multiplex CRISPR interference. I&amp;rsquo;m a Texas native, graduated from Rice University with a BS in Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, and worked at Glycos Biotechnologies Inc.</description>
