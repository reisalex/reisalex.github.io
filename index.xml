      <description>Synthetic biologists, our group included, have been drawn by the power of CRISPR technologies1 to completely revolutionize how we program cell behavior, for example, by designing programmable CRISPR-based genetic circuits. Genetic circuits, like digital ones, take input signals from the surrounding environment (e.g. relevant biologics, chemicals, temperature, UV), and through a series of logic gates, perform computation or “signal processing”, with useful output that can be read out or passed to biological actuators within a programmed cell.</description>

      <description>Over the last few weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, limited availability and throughput of the existing COVID-19 test kit has hindered our ability to monitor the global spread of the causal virus, SARS-CoV-2. As of March 24nd, the CDC reported having only tested 4,651 and 83,391 patients across the U.S. in CDC and public health laboratories, respectively, since January 18th &amp;ndash; with the bulk of those tests done within the past week.</description>

      <description>Hello! I&amp;rsquo;m a scientist working in the emerging field of synthetic biology. Synthetic biology aims at harnessing biology to tackle global issues in energy, health, materials, and the environment. Synbio stands apart from its parent fields, such as &amp;ldquo;genetic engineering&amp;rdquo;, through its use of next-generation technologies, such as the ability to read and write DNA at scale with high fidelty. My research specifically leverages these omics technologies and biophysical modeling to predict how biological systems behave, as encoded by their DNA.</description>

      <description>RBS Calculator In 2009, Salis et al. published RBS Calculator v1.0, a thermodynamic equilibrium model of translation initiation rate in bacteria, for tunable protein expression control. Since then a number of minor improvements have been made to the model to increase its accuracy (to v2.1). I am actively developing a &amp;ldquo;v3.0&amp;rdquo; to account for non-equilibirium behavior of RNA folding dynamics at the ribosome binding site. More on this soon.
pyfold As part of the development effort for RBS Calculator v3.</description>
