      <description>Model-driven protein engineering is the future of synbio. The ability to engineer proteins to do any chemical conversion imaginable (enzymes) or to perform complex biological tasks like edit or regulate genes would revolutionize the way we engineer biology. Existing tools however remain largely limited in what they can make, with most research still focused on getting designed proteins to fold correctly1, so protein engineering remains one of synthetic biology&amp;rsquo;s grand challenges.</description>

      <description>Synthetic biologists, our group included, have been drawn by the power of CRISPR technologies1 to completely revolutionize how we program cell behavior, for example, by designing programmable CRISPR-based genetic circuits. Genetic circuits, like digital ones, take input signals from the surrounding environment (e.g. relevant biologics, chemicals, temperature, UV), and through a series of logic gates, perform computation or “signal processing”, with useful output that can be read out or passed to biological actuators within a programmed cell.</description>

      <description>Over the last few weeks of the COVID-19 pandemic, limited availability and throughput of the existing COVID-19 test kit has hindered our ability to monitor the global spread of the causal virus, SARS-CoV-2. As of March 24nd, the CDC reported having only tested 4,651 and 83,391 patients across the U.S. in CDC and public health laboratories, respectively, since January 18th &amp;ndash; with the bulk of those tests done within the past week.</description>
